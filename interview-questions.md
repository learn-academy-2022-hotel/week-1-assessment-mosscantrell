# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software that allows you to track the changes made in your code. GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform used to share, store, and collaborate on code.

Researched answer: While Git and GitHub do have similar names, git is a version control system that is hosted on your local device and GitHub is a cloud-based service that acts as a hosting site for git repositories. GitHub allows you to collaborate with others, as well as view and share work, using git's branching model to track the history of yours and others' code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: There are three types of JavaScript operators that return a Boolean value. These include equality operators (strict and loose equality represented as "===" and "==" respectively), logical operators (and "&&", or "||", and bang "!"), and relational operators ("<", ">", "<=", ">="). These three operators all return a Boolean value as they all evaluate whether the provided information is true or false.

Researched answer: The JavaScript operators that return a Boolean value include equality operators, logical operators, and relational operators. These are each used in various arguments within code to determine whether the result of a given argument is truthy or falsey. Some operators, such as the logical OR (||), are looking for only one element to be true or false. Others, like the logical AND (&&), require all elements to be either true or false. Each operator is used differently to achieve desired results.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the position of an element within an array. Values, on the other hand, are the various data types JavaScript can run such as numbers, strings, and symbols. In other words, values are the elements, while the index is simply the position of that value when present in an array.

Researched answer: An index is the position of a value within an array, while the values are whichever data types are present within said array. Index can also determine the position of a character within a string, while the string itself would be the value in question.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings have a few similarities; you can use index on both to find the position of values and characters respectively, and both can be attributed to variables. They also have their differences; arrays can hold multiple data types while a string is a data type of its own, arrays are stored in square brackets while strings are held within quotation marks, and strings have the ability to display any variable in plain text using string interpolation while arrays have no such ability.

Researched answer: Both arrays and strings have a length property, you can find the index of both arrays and strings, and both can be attributed to variables. However, arrays can contain any data type while strings are a data type of their own, and strings are typically processed sequentially by character while the elements within an array are typically randomly accessed.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: There are many facets to pair programming properly. One way to view this is through the navigator and driver analogy. This sees one person as the "driver", writing and uploading code, while the "navigator" provides input and does research to assist the driver. You must be respectful of your partner when pair programming-- no back seat driving or calling all the shots without consulting the other person (to keep with the analogy).

Researched answer: While there are many facets to proper pair programming, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that both you and your partner are getting the most out of it. Preparing for the coding session, working together respectfully, facilitating learning for both people, as well as communicating through both success and challenges are excellent techniques to follow to have a fulfilling pair programming session.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A Higher-Order Function is a function that can accept another function as its parameter and/or return another function.

2. Jest: Jest is a software that facilitates the testing of JavaScript code for correctness.

3. Objects: An object in JavaScript is an element that has properties and functionality. It typically consists of several different variables and/or functions.

4. Method: A method is an action that is performed on an object, similar to a function.

5. Classes: Classes are a type of function used as a stepping stone in creating objects.
